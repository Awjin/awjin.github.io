title: 'Redesign: Artflow Settings Menu'
---

[ArtFlow](http://artflowstudio.com/) is my favorite drawing tool. It's got a lot of useful features, with a fully-featured settings menu to match. Let's see if we can redesign the menu for better usability.

## Ease In

Start with the low-hanging fruit. Deleting unneeded elements reduces clutter and minimizes what we need to redesign.

## Harmonize

The look of each element should convey consistent meaning.

We should:
  1. Place and style these differently (the first is a description and the second displays current value).
  1. Use different colors (the toggle is clickable but the text isn't).
  1. Align their styles (both are disabled).

## Punctuate

We can add whitespace to group related options into scannable chunks. We could also rearrange items within their parent containerâ€”do they need more breathing room?

## The Product

Before...

... and after.

The result is more consistent and organized.
