    <strong>Awjin</strong> is a UX Engineer.
  </h1>

  <h2>
    I'm passionate about making the web more usable. I believe the continuous
    melding of design and engineering thinking is the way.
  </h2>

  <h2>
    I use my fluency in both fields to help teams communicate, make
    great decisions, and create simpler things. Currently, I'm at Google
    working on Sass infrastructure.
  </h2>

  <p>
    These are some of my core beliefs:
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I respect kind, diverse, talented people who value empathy and pursue
        perfection.
      </li>
      <li>
        Products should serve both the user and the maker, with equally clean
        UX and code.
      </li>
      <li>
        The strongest ideas start as a clear intuition, then get built and
        validated through data-driven design.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
