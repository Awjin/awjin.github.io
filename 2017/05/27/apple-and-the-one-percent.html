    <p><em>This Pencil isn’t working.</em></p>

<p><em>How do I—I plug it into the lightning port, right? Bluetooth’s on… Pencil’s charged…</em></p>

<p><em>Alright, I’ll pair it manually. Hmm, I have to navigate <strong>three</strong> menus to do this?</em></p>

<h2 id="im-no-luddite">I’m no Luddite</h2>

<p>But this encounter with the Pencil was frustrating. Apple products are famous for “just working.” Since I expected the Pencil to pair flawlessly, I wasn’t prepared for it to fail.</p>

<p>If we believe something will work properly 100% of the time, 99% isn’t good enough. The 1% of failure is totally unexpected and stings hard. This is Apple’s conundrum—self-imposed by their vision of seamlessness and possibly a losing race.</p>

<h2 id="android-manages-expectations">Android manages expectations</h2>

<p>Android doesn’t “just work.” Instead, it exposes popular settings for easy access. When I need to pair something, the bluetooth menu is one swipe and touch away. And if there’s a glitch, I know exactly how to toggle the bluetooth on and off and repeat the ritual. By setting expectations low, Android thrives on all sorts of imperfect hardware. The tradeoff is a less sexy and more hands-on interface.</p>

<h2 id="im-not-advocating-for-either">I’m not advocating for either</h2>

<p>Both approaches to user interaction have their challenges. That being said, Apple gets pretty close to nailing that 1%. And if any company could do it, it’d be Apple, with their iron control of hardware and software. The journey to perfection is high-stakes though—a 0.1% failure rate will feel exponentially worse than 1%, and so on, until they succeed in squashing it to zero.</p>
